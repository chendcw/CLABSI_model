# CLABSI_compare_models
The project shares the code used to compare different models (binary, multinomial, Cox, cause-specific and Fine-Gray) for 7-days CLABSI prediction.
The playground directory contains R scripts used to:


create baseline models (BASE_model_MF_xx_xx_days)


create dynamic models (DYN_model_MF_xx_xx_days)


sample size calculation (sample_size_calculation)


baseline model performance summaries (summary_table_BASE)


dynamic model performance summaries (summary_table_DYN)


The R directory contains functions used to build and evaluate the models


BASE_DYN_functions contains the functions used to build and evaluate the models


config_playgorund_model_building contains some general configuration loaded before model building
